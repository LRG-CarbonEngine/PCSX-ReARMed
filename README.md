# PCSX-ReARMed
 
PCSX ReARMed is yet another PCSX fork based on the PCSX-Reloaded project, which itself contains code from PCSX, PCSX-df and PCSX-Revolution. This version is ARM architecture oriented and features MIPS->ARM recompiler by Ari64, NEON GTE code and more performance improvements. It was created for Pandora handheld, but should be usable on other devices after some code adjustments (N900, GPH Wiz/Caanoo, PlayBook versions are also available).

PCSX-ReARMed features ARM NEON GPU by Exophase, that in many cases produces pixel perfect graphics at very high performance. There is also Una-i's GPU plugin from PCSX4ALL project, and traditional P.E.Op.S. one.
